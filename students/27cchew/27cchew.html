					Hello! My name is Christina, and I am currently a Sophomore. So far, I like being in Sound Crew because everyone in Tech Crew forms a little family that helps each other. We all have a common goal: to be a part of the productions and learn more from Mr. Mahoney. I plan on joining LVY since I always enjoy helping others and volunteering to help those in need in the community. Lastly, I enjoy being part of the leadership team for Creative Writing because writing has always been something I have been interested in since I was a little kid. It is a way for me to express my emotions since I cannot draw or do art. Moving past clubs, I enjoy being in chorus because I find it a place where everyone can improve their singing, without judgment. We have just started the school year, but I enjoy many of my classes so far. One of my favorites is AP Psychology. It is a difficult subject, but it truly challenges you to contemplate humans and our ways of thinking and behaving. I enjoy the scientific, philosophical, and historical facets of this class. Another one that I enjoy is Chemistry 3,4 Honors because it is both a physical science and based on math, both of which I truly enjoy doing. In addition, my parents are chemists, so they instilled in me a love for science and math ever since I was young. At the same time, I also really enjoy English 3,4 Honors since I have enjoyed reading and thinking about the deeper meaning of books ever since I was a little kid. Some of my fondest memories are of reading with my mother in a library when I was just a toddler. I love how someone’s words can trigger your imagination and bring up some of your memories as well. I always loved getting lost in a book. On top of that, I love how English class helps introduce me to other genres while developing my writing style. <br>
					Outside of academics, I love playing the piano, even though I am not very good at it. It calms me down and helps me relax. Ever since I was young, I began to learn to play the piano from my mother. Playing the piano is a way for us to bond while I learn more from her. I am also in chorus, so playing the piano also helps me learn to read music and vice versa. Moreover, I enjoy listening to music. I listen to a variety of genres, but overall, it always gets me relaxed and calms me down. I firmly believe that music is a universal language and can connect people, regardless of what nationality they are or what language they speak. I also find it astonishing that music, like writing, can trigger emotions and memories in us, sometimes without words. Additionally, I enjoy reading novels and writing poetry. They can help me escape the chaos of reality, an activity I can do anywhere that helps me forget about my problems. Like I said before, I was never good at art, so this is a way for me to express my emotions. Additionally, I enjoy baking and cooking. I love making food for my loved ones that they enjoy, so it brings me a lot of happiness. Some of my favorite things to bake are brownies and cookies, while I enjoy making breakfast for my family. Furthermore, over the past year, I have taken up crocheting, which also helps soothe me and helps me unwind. I enjoy how you can see the process you go through to improve. I also find it very cool how the more you learn, the more those skills can be applied to make gifts for your loved ones as well. Lastly, I enjoy nature. Therefore, you will often find me walking in Golden Gate Park, while looking closely at the plants and flowers all around me.
