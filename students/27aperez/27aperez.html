                   Hi! My name is Ava Perez and I am currently a sophomore at SHC. I play the flute for the SHC Band and I’m a member of Sports Medicine. I’m looking forward to joining more clubs once the Activity Fair takes place!
Outside of school, I recently received my black belt in Taekwondo, which I have been dedicated to for 6 years. This was an amazing achievement for me and this journey led me down a remarkable path, where I developed as a person. I am also participating in Kali, which is traditional Filipino stick fighting, as well as Jiu-jitsu. Incorporating self-defense in my life has been an on-going passion and I’m proud to say I’m surrounding myself with multiple backgrounds of it. Along with learning martial arts, I enjoy learning ASL, considering it is one of my favorite classes at SHC. Since freshman year, I’ve loved this class and I can’t wait to continue developing my knowledge and skills of the language.
This year, I’m proud to say I officially completed my first i2 project and have a sense of what to expect as my second i2 project approaches. From the past year, I’ve learned what the project entails and what is expected of me. I will apply the advice and feedback I obtained from my prior project to my future endeavor. I’m very fortunate to be one of the students within the i2 Program and I’m absolutely grateful for the opportunities and experiences.  I’m excited for what i2 has in store for the future and what a difference I and my fellow members can make.
